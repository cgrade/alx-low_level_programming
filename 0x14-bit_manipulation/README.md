# 0x14.C - Bit manipulation

**Learnt How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators**
 * learnt the core concept behind bit manituplation and how to use the bitise operation.

**Below are the Project tasks I did during the course of this Concept

## Tasks :page_with_curl: 

* [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c) : Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int` .
 * Prototype: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
 * where `b` is pointing to a string of `0` and `1` chars
 * Return: the converted number, or 0 if
  * there is one or more chars in the string `b` that is not `0` or `1`
  * `b` is `NULL`
