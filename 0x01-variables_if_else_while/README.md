# 0x01. C Variables, if, else and while loops

In this project i learnt about Variables, if statements, else statements and the while loop statements.
## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive or negative**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): C program that prints wether a randomly generated numbe is negative, positive or zero, followed by a new line.

* **1. The Last Digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): C program that prints a randomly generated number and specify if
    * the `Last digit of` the number followed is greater than `5`
    * the `Last digit is 0`
    * the `Last digit is less than 6 and not 0` followed by a new line
    

* **2. Print alphabet**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): A C program that prints all the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.

* **3. alphABET**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): A C program that prints the alphabets in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

* **4. Alphabt**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](./print_alphabt.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercaser except letter `q` and `e` followed by a new line.

* **5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` followed by a new line..

* **6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` followed by a new line. restricted to:
    * not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
    * limited to the use of `putchar`
    * `printf` and `puts` are forbidden

* **7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order followed by a new line, and we can only use the `putchar` function `printf`and `puts` are forbidden. and can only use `putchar` twice.

* **8. Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](./print_base16.c): A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, only `putchar` was used.

* **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](./9_print_comb.c): A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers with the following conditions:
    * numbers must be separated by `,` followed by space
    * numbers should be printed in ascending order
    * limited to the use of only 4 `putchar` functions as (`printf and puts` are forbidden)

* **10.  Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c): A program that prints all the possible different combination of two digits with the following condition:
    * numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
    * the two digits must be different: `01` and `10` are considered the same
    * Limited to the use of 5 `putchar` functions only, (`printf` and `puts` are forbidden)
  
* **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
  * [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c): A C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits with the followeing conditions:
    * numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
    * The three digits must be different
    * `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201`, `210` are considered the same combinations of `0`, `1` and `2`.
    * Prints only the smallest combination of three digits
    * not allowed to use the variable type `char`
    * Limited to 6 `putchar` functions as the use of `printf` and `puts` are forbidden.

* **12. Software is eating the World**
  * [102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c): A C program that prints all possible combinatios of two two-digit numbers.
    * The numbers should range from `0` to `99`
    * The two numbers should be separated by a space
    * limited to the use of 8 `putchar` functions only.
    * Not allowed to use any variable of type `char`

  learning all these was pretty interesting!!
